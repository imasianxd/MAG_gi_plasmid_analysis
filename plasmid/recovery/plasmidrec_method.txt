Plasmid recovery from metagenome-assembled genomes

1) Recovered plasmids from the input dataset were detected by BLASTing their sequences (query) against contig sequences (subject) in each bin. 
- raw BLAST output: plasmid/blastout

2) BLAST hits, of which the matched alignment against the reference plasmid sequences was less than 50% of the contig length, were removed. This gets rid of any poorly-assembled contigs with short matches at multiple locations on a plasmid sequence.
- filtered BLAST output: plasmid/recovery/blastout50

3) Per-base recovery of plasmids was calculated based by the number of non-overlapping plasmid bases covered by all contigs within a bin, divided by the total number of bases of the plasmid. Not all of plasmids from the simulated dataset were recovered due to poor BLAST alignment of the metagenome-assembled contigs.

4) Contig regions containing plasmid sequences were extracted from each bin.
